# Code Quiz

## Description

Submission for Module 6 of the University of Birmingham Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development &amp; UX.

This assignment took a starter code package in commit [8a1f771](https://github.com/Stefan4D/code-quiz/commit/8a1f771cbfc36b423e746d917541ec1c5354b5a4) and developed it to meet the defined acceptance criteria.

The production website is deployed [here](https://stefan4d.github.io/code-quiz/).

This has been developed to meet the following Acceptance Criteria:

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score

## Learning Outcomes

- Re-visited the use of default versus named exports and fixed an error where I was using a default export and importing using named syntax
- Practiced using the .classList.remove() method that had learned on a Net Ninja course previously
- Learned how to store and retrieve data with localStorage
- Learned how to sort an array of objects
- Learned that the forEach method also has an index argument / parameter that holds the index within the input array of the current element
- Learned about moving variables into and out of global scope to make them available across different function in my program to achieve the desired behaviour
- Learned about using .matches() to see if an element matches a CSS selector, which I used to only target buttons within the choices div. I also learned this is called event delegation.
- Learned how to create audio elements offscreen and how to play them in response to an event
