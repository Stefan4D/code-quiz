## Learning Outcomes

- Re-visited the use of default versus named exports and fixed an error where I was using a default export and importing using named syntax
- Practiced using the .classList.remove() method that had learned on a Net Ninja course previously
- Learned how to store and retrieve data with localStorage
- Learned how to sort an array of objects
- Learned that the forEach method also has an index argument / parameter that holds the index within the input array of the current element
- Learned about moving variables into and out of global scope to make them available across different function in my program to achieve the desired behaviour
- Learned about using .matches() to see if an element matches a CSS selector, which I used to only target buttons within the choices div
